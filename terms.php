              to and use of the Services (including all activities and transactions) 
              by any Authorized User and/or User ID registered under Customer's 
              account, unless such access to or use of the Services is the direct 
              result solely of the gross negligence of YouSendIt. It is Customer's 
              responsibility, through its systems administrator Authorized User, 
              to set the appropriate access for each of Customer's Authorized 
              Users.</p>
            <h5> 5.3 Responsibility for User IDs and Passwords</h5>

              confirmation of an order or orders placed using Customer's account 
              which Customer did not place or any similar conflicting report; 
              or (b) Customer becomes aware of any unauthorized use of any product 
              or service related to its account(s). </p>

              which letter shall include statements of authenticity, authority, 
              and liability as required by YouSendIt in its sole discretion. Customer 
              expressly and irrevocably agrees that YouSendIt may rely on such 
              a letter and on the apparent authority of the person requesting 
              access to the Services or to Customer's account. In no event will

              or discontinue the Service, temporarily or permanently, with or 
              without notice to you. You agree that we shall not be liable to 
              you or any third party for any modification, suspension or discontinuance 
              of the Service. You acknowledge that we may establish general practices 
              and limits concerning use of the Service, including the maximum 
              disk space that will be allotted on YouSendIt’s servers on 
              your behalf, and the maximum number of times (and the maximum duration 
              for which) you may access the Service in a given period of time. 
              Further, you acknowledge that YouSendIt may change subscription 
              fees at any time without notice. Changes in subscription fees will 
              take effect on expiration of any existing Customer subscription.</p>
            <font size="2" color="#426984"><b>13. Termination</b></font>
            <p>13.1 Without limiting other remedies, YouSendIt may immediately 
              issue a warning, suspend (i.e., lock out access and operation of 
              Services for Customer) either temporarily or indefinitely, or terminate 
              Customer's account and refuse to provide Services to Customer if: 
              (a) YouSendIt believes that Customer have violated or acted inconsistently 
              with this Agreement, or any of our policies; or (b) Customer have 
              failed to pay fees or other payments due to YouSendIt; or (c) YouSendIt 
              is unable to verify or authenticate any information Customer provides 
              to YouSendIt; or (d) YouSendIt believes that Customer's actions 
              may cause legal liability for Customer, YouSendIt’s other 
              clients, or YouSendIt. </p>
            <p>YouSendIt may also in its sole discretion and at any time discontinue 
              providing the Service, or any part thereof, with or without notice. 
              You agree that any termination of your access to the Service under 
              any provision of these terms and conditions may be effected without 
              prior notice, and acknowledge and agree that YouSendIt may immediately 
              deactivate, archive or delete your account and all related information 
              and data and/or any further access to such data or the Service. 
              Further, you agree that YouSendIt shall not be liable to you or 
              any third-party for any termination of your access to the Service.</p>
            <p>Upon termination of this Agreement by either Customer or YouSendIt, 
              all of Customer rights under this Agreement, and YouSendIt's provision 
              of Services, will terminate immediately. </p>
            <p>13.2 The Sections 6 ("Customer Data"), 9 ("No Warranty"), 
              10 ("Indemnity"), 11 ("Limitation Of Liability") 
              and this Section 13 will survive any termination of this Agreement. 
            </p>
            <font size="2" color="#426984"><b> 14. Miscellaneous</b></font>
            <p>These terms and conditions will be governed by and construed in 
              accordance with the laws of the State of California, excluding that 
              body of law governing conflict of laws. Any legal action or proceeding 
              relating to or arising out of these Terms or your use of the Web 
              site will be brought in a federal or state court in Santa Clara 
              County, California, and you submit to the venue and personal jurisdiction 
              of such court. If any provision of these Terms is held to be invalid 
              or unenforceable, such provision will be enforced to the greatest 
              extent possible and the remaining provisions will remain in full 
              force and effect. Headings are for reference purposes only and in 
              no way define, limit, construe, or describe the scope or extent 
              of such section. YouSendIt's failure to act with respect to a breach 
              by Customer or others does not waive YouSendIt’s right to 
              act with respect to subsequent or similar breaches. No action by 
              Customer arising under this Agreement may be brought at any time 
              more than twelve (12) months after the facts occurred upon which 
              the cause of action arose. </p>
            <h5>14.1 Relationship</h5>
            <p>Customer and YouSendIt are independent contractors, and no agency, 
              partnership, joint venture, employee-employer or franchiser-franchisee 
              relationship is intended or created by this Agreement. </p>
            <h5>14.2 Assignment</h5>
            <p>Customer may not assign any of its rights, or delegate any of its 
              duties, under this Agreement, and any attempted assignment will 
              be null and void. </p>
            <h5>14.4 Force Majeure</h5>
            <p>Operation of our Services may be interfered with by numerous factors 
              outside of our control and we shall not be liable to you for any 
              delay or failure in performance under this Agreement resulting directly 
              or indirectly from causes beyond YouSendIt’s control. </p>
            <h5>14.5 Interpretation</h5>
            <p>If any provision of this Agreement is held to be invalid or unenforceable, 
              such provision shall be struck, as narrowly as possible, and the 
              remaining provisions shall be enforced. Headings are for reference 
              purposes only and in no way define, limit, construe or describe 
              the scope or extent of such section. </p>
            <h5>14.6 YouSendIt Confidential Information</h5>
            <p>You represent and warrant to YouSendIt that (a) you are not a competitor 
              of YouSendIt, (b) you shall keep publicly unannounced information 
              and materials pertaining to YouSendIt, pre-release software, testing 
              or testing procedures strictly confidential and (c) you shall not 
              use any information gained from access to the YouSendIt Web site 
              or use of the YouSendIt Services to compete with YouSendIt in its 
              business.</p>
            <h5>14.7 Exceptions</h5>
            <p>Except for other agreements or terms appearing on the Web site,
